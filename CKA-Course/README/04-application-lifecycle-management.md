# Application Lifecycle, Climbed the Ladder 🪜
### Section 4 of the CKA — deriving how apps are configured, updated, and scaled

> Running and evolving apps: rollouts/rollbacks, commands/args, env + ConfigMaps + Secrets, and multi-container/init/sidecar patterns. We climb from **the pain of updating apps by hand** → **the one "it's all the pod template" idea** → **the machinery** → then the commands as predictions. Each rung ends with a **✅ Check yourself**.

---

# RUNG 0 — The Setup 🎯

**What am I learning?** Everything about an app's life *after* you can create a pod: updating it with zero downtime, feeding it config and secrets, controlling its process, running helper containers, and scaling it.

**Why did it land on my desk?** *Workloads & Scheduling* is 15% of the CKA, and ConfigMaps/Secrets/rollouts show up in tasks and in troubleshooting (bad config = `CrashLoopBackOff`). This is high-YAML, high-imperative-shortcut territory.

**What do I already know?** Probably `kubectl set image`. What's fuzzy: why a rollout is "safe," the `command`↔`args` Docker trap, and that Secrets are *not* encrypted.

---

# RUNG 1 — The Pain 🔥
### *Why does lifecycle management exist at all?*

You can create a Deployment. Now real life happens: you need to ship v2, change a setting, rotate a password, and handle a spike — without an outage.

```
LIFE WITHOUT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT (the pain)

  new version   ─▶ stop ALL v1, start ALL v2         → downtime window, and no undo
  change a config value ─▶ rebuild the image, redeploy → 20-min loop for a one-line change
  a password    ─▶ baked into the image / in Git      → leaked forever
  bad deploy    ─▶ "how do we get back to yesterday?"  → panic, manual rollback
  traffic spike ─▶ SSH in and start more copies        → too slow, done by hand
```

**Before / without it:** config and secrets were baked into images (rebuild to change anything), updates were stop-the-world, and there was no revision history to roll back to.

**What breaks without it:** availability (no zero-downtime updates), agility (config changes need image rebuilds), security (secrets in images), and recoverability (no rollback).

**Who feels it most?** Everyone shipping software — but the platform team owns making updates *safe and reversible* for every team.

> **✅ Check yourself before Rung 2:** Name two things that force an image rebuild in the "before" world that Kubernetes lets you change *without* touching the image. (Hint: a setting, and a password.)

---

# RUNG 2 — The One Idea 💡
### *The single sentence everything hangs off*

> **An app's entire life — the process it runs, the config and secrets it reads, how many copies exist, and how it's upgraded — is described in the Deployment's **pod template**; change the template and the Deployment performs a **rollout**: a new ReplicaSet scaled up as the old one scales down, recorded as a revision you can reverse.**

Derivations:
- *"the process it runs"* → `command`/`args` in the template override the image's ENTRYPOINT/CMD.
- *"config and secrets it reads"* → `env` / ConfigMaps / Secrets injected into the template; changing them is a template change → a new rollout.
- *"how many copies"* → `replicas` (scaling) — or an HPA driving it from metrics.
- *"how it's upgraded… new RS up as old scales down"* → this is why updates are **zero-downtime** and **contained**: a bad new version only affects the *new* ReplicaSet while the old keeps serving.
- *"recorded as a revision you can reverse"* → `kubectl rollout undo` = reconcile back to a previous template.

Once you see **every change is "edit the pod template, Kubernetes reconciles,"** rollouts, config, and scaling stop being separate topics.

> **✅ Check yourself before Rung 3:** If you `kubectl set image` a Deployment to a broken image, why do your *existing* users usually keep getting served during the failed rollout? (Hint: which ReplicaSet are the broken pods in?)

---

# RUNG 3 — The Machinery ⚙️
### *How it ACTUALLY works — go slow*

## (A) The rollout engine

A Deployment version = **rollout → new ReplicaSet → revision**. Kubernetes scales the new RS up while scaling the old down, one batch at a time.

```
RollingUpdate (default):  [v1 v1 v1 v1] → [v1 v1 v1 v2] → … → [v2 v2 v2 v2]   (seamless)
Recreate:                 [v1 v1 v1 v1] → [           ] → [v2 v2 v2 v2]        (downtime!)
```

| Strategy | Behavior | Downtime |
|---|---|---|
| **RollingUpdate** (default) | new RS up / old RS down in batches (`maxSurge`, `maxUnavailable`, default 25% each) | none |
| **Recreate** | kill all old, then create all new | brief outage |

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/web            # watch it
kubectl rollout history deployment/web           # revisions
kubectl set image deployment/web nginx=nginx:1.26   # imperative update (drifts from your file)
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml                         # declarative (file = source of truth)
kubectl rollout undo deployment/web                  # roll back to previous
kubectl rollout undo deployment/web --to-revision=2
```
> 🎯 `set image` is fastest but your YAML no longer matches the live object. Switch strategy by editing `spec.strategy.type` (remove the `rollingUpdate:` block for `Recreate`). A bad new version = `CrashLoopBackOff`/`ImagePullBackOff` on the *new* RS → `kubectl rollout undo`.

## (B) The process it runs — command & args

A container runs **one process**; when it exits, the container exits. The image's `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD` set that process; the pod overrides them:

| Docker | Pod field | Overrides |
|---|---|---|
| `ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]` | `command:` | the executable |
| `CMD ["5"]` | `args:` | its default arguments |

```yaml
# Image: ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]  CMD ["5"]  → default "sleep 5"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ubuntu-sleeper
    image: ubuntu-sleeper
    command: ["sleep"]     # overrides ENTRYPOINT
    args: ["10"]           # overrides CMD → "sleep 10"
```
⚠️ **The trap:** `command` = ENTRYPOINT, **not** Docker's `CMD`. Array elements must be **strings** (`["sleep","5000"]`). Imperatively: everything after `--` is **args**; add `--command` to override the entrypoint too:
```bash
kubectl run web --image=webapp-color -- --color green     # args
kubectl run app --image=busybox --command -- sleep 1000   # command
```

## (C) Config & secrets — externalize what varies

**ConfigMap** (non-secret) and **Secret** (sensitive) are the same shape; you **create** then **inject**.

```bash
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_COLOR=blue --from-file=app.properties
kubectl create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=DB_PASSWORD='p@ss'
echo -n 'mysql' | base64        # encode for declarative YAML   |   base64 -d to decode
```
Inject three ways (identical for ConfigMap/Secret — swap `configMapRef`↔`secretRef`):
```yaml
envFrom:                                   # (a) whole object as env vars
- configMapRef: { name: app-config }
- secretRef:    { name: db-secret }
env:                                        # (b) one key → one env var
- name: APP_COLOR
  valueFrom: { configMapKeyRef: { name: app-config, key: APP_COLOR } }
volumes:                                    # (c) as files in a volume
- name: cfg
  configMap: { name: app-config }
```
> ⚠️ **Secrets are base64-*encoded*, not encrypted** — anyone with etcd/API access can decode them. Safety comes from *practice*: don't commit secret YAML, enable **encryption at rest**, use RBAC. Kubernetes helps: a Secret is only sent to nodes that need it and the kubelet keeps it in **tmpfs (RAM)**.

**Encryption at rest** (make etcd store secrets encrypted):
```bash
# 1) EncryptionConfiguration with an aescbc/secretbox provider + a base64 32-byte key
# 2) add to kube-apiserver.yaml:  --encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml (+ mount)
# 3) verify it's no longer plaintext in etcd:
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cacert=... --cert=... --key=... get /registry/secrets/default/my-secret | hexdump -C
kubectl get secrets -A -o json | kubectl replace -f -   # re-encrypt EXISTING secrets
```
Provider **order matters** — the *first* encrypts; put `identity` (no encryption) last. Only new/updated secrets get encrypted until you re-`replace`.

## (D) Multi-container patterns

Helpers that share the pod's **network (localhost), storage, and lifecycle** without merging code:

```
┌──────────────── Pod ────────────────┐
│ initContainers (run to completion,   │  ← wait for DB, run migrations (in ORDER, exit 0)
│    in ORDER)                         │
│           ↓ then                     │
│ containers: [ main-app, sidecar ]    │  ← run together for the pod's life
│    share localhost + volumes         │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Pattern | Where | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| **Co-located** | extra entries in `containers:` | start together, run for pod life |
| **Init** | `initContainers:` | sequential, **to completion**, before main; each exits 0 |
| **Sidecar** (native v1.33+) | `initContainers:` + `restartPolicy: Always` | starts first, **stays running** alongside |

```yaml
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: init-db
    image: busybox:1.31
    command: ["sh","-c","until nslookup mydb; do sleep 2; done"]
  - name: log-sidecar               # native sidecar
    image: busybox:1.31
    restartPolicy: Always
    command: ["sh","-c","while true; do echo shipping logs; sleep 10; done"]
  containers:
  - { name: app, image: busybox:1.28, command: ["sh","-c","echo run && sleep 3600"] }
```
> 🎯 A pod stuck `Init:0/2` is waiting on an **init container** → `kubectl logs <pod> -c <init-name>`. `restartPolicy` is **container-level** (a crashed container restarts in place).

## (E) Scaling
```bash
kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=5
kubectl autoscale deployment web --min=2 --max=10 --cpu-percent=70   # HPA (needs Metrics Server)
```

> **✅ Check yourself before Rung 4:** Three questions, one each: (1) which pod field overrides the image's ENTRYPOINT? (2) which injection method makes a ConfigMap show up as *files*? (3) does base64-encoding a Secret make it secure — why/why not?

---

# RUNG 4 — The Vocabulary Map 🏷️

| Term | What it actually is | Machinery |
|---|---|---|
| **Rollout** | The process of moving to a new template version | Rollout engine |
| **Revision** | A saved snapshot of a rollout (for rollback) | `rollout history/undo` |
| **RollingUpdate / Recreate** | Strategies: batched swap / stop-all-start-all | `spec.strategy` |
| **maxSurge / maxUnavailable** | How many extra/absent pods during a roll | RollingUpdate knobs |
| **command / args** | ENTRYPOINT / CMD overrides | The container process |
| **env / envFrom / valueFrom** | Inject one var / whole object / one key | Config injection |
| **ConfigMap** | Externalized non-secret config | Config |
| **Secret** | Base64 (not encrypted) sensitive config | Config |
| **encryption at rest** | Make etcd store secrets encrypted | apiserver provider |
| **initContainer** | Runs to completion before the app | Multi-container |
| **sidecar** | Long-running helper (init + `restartPolicy: Always`) | Multi-container |
| **restartPolicy** | Always/OnFailure/Never, per **container** | Lifecycle |
| **HPA** | Autoscaler driving `replicas` from metrics | Scaling |

**The unlock:** everything is a **pod-template field** (`command`, `env`, `initContainers`, `replicas`). Change any → new template → the Deployment reconciles via a rollout. ConfigMap and Secret are *the same object* with different sensitivity + injection keyword.

> **✅ Check yourself before Rung 5:** Which of these trigger a new rollout when changed on a Deployment: `image`, `env`, `replicas`? (Two do something different from the third — which, and why?)

---

# RUNG 5 — The Trace 🎬

**Trace — a rolling update, then a rollback:**
1. `kubectl set image deployment/web nginx=nginx:1.26` edits the **pod template**.
2. The Deployment controller creates a **new ReplicaSet** (revision 2) at 0 replicas.
3. It scales the **new RS +1** (`maxSurge`) and, as those pods pass **readiness**, scales the **old RS −1** (`maxUnavailable`). Repeat batch by batch.
4. At each step total capacity stays ~100%, so **users never see downtime**; the old RS serves until the new pods are Ready.
5. You push a bad `nginx:doesnotexist`: the new RS's pods go `ImagePullBackOff` and **never become Ready**, so the rollout **stalls with the old RS still serving** — the failure is contained.
6. `kubectl rollout undo deployment/web` re-selects the previous template; the good old RS scales back to full, the bad RS to 0.

```
set image ─▶ template v2 ─▶ new RS(0) ──surge+1──▶ new pods Ready? ──yes──▶ old RS −1 … ─▶ all v2
                                              └── no (bad image) → stall, old RS keeps serving
undo ─▶ template v1 ─▶ old RS back to full, bad RS → 0
```

**Trace — config reaches the app:** at container start, the kubelet reads the referenced ConfigMap/Secret and sets the env vars (or mounts the volume) *before* running the process, so `printenv` inside shows `APP_COLOR`. Change the ConfigMap later → env vars **don't** update live (you must roll the pods); a mounted volume *does* eventually update.

> **✅ Check yourself before Rung 6:** In step 5, what specific pod condition stops the rollout from proceeding — and why is that the safety mechanism, not a bug?

---

# RUNG 6 — The Contrast ⚖️

| This… | vs that… | Difference |
|---|---|---|
| **RollingUpdate** | **Recreate** | zero-downtime batched swap vs stop-all (needed when versions can't coexist) |
| **command** | **args** | overrides ENTRYPOINT (the program) vs CMD (its arguments) |
| **ConfigMap** | **Secret** | non-sensitive plaintext vs base64 sensitive (+ tmpfs, need-to-know delivery) |
| **env injection** | **volume mount** | fixed at start, no live update vs file that can update live |
| **init container** | **sidecar** | runs once to completion, blocks app vs runs alongside for pod life |
| **`set image`** | **`apply -f`** | fast but drifts from file vs file stays source of truth |

**When NOT to:** don't use `Recreate` for a stateless web app (needless downtime); don't put real secrets in a ConfigMap; don't rely on env-injected config updating live (it won't — roll the pods).

**One-sentence "why this over that":**
> Edit the pod template and let a RollingUpdate reconcile for zero-downtime, reversible changes; externalize settings to ConfigMaps and sensitive values to Secrets (with encryption at rest); use init containers to *gate* startup and sidecars to *accompany* the app.

> **✅ Check yourself before Rung 7:** A colleague changed a ConfigMap value but the running pods still show the old value. Explain *why*, and what makes it take effect.

---

# RUNG 7 — The Prediction Test 🧪

## Prediction 1 — A bad image is contained to the new ReplicaSet

> **My prediction:** "If I `set image` to a non-existent tag, then new pods go `ImagePullBackOff` and the rollout stalls, but the app stays up — *because* the old RS keeps serving until the new pods are Ready, which they never become; `rollout undo` restores it."

```bash
kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx:1.25 --replicas=4
kubectl set image deployment/web nginx=nginx:1.26 && kubectl rollout status deployment/web
kubectl set image deployment/web nginx=nginx:doesnotexist
kubectl get pods                 # new pods ImagePullBackOff; old still Running
kubectl rollout undo deployment/web
```
**Verify:** during the bad roll, old pods keep serving; after `undo`, all run 1.26. If the whole app went down, check you weren't on `Recreate`.

## Prediction 2 — Injected config is immutable on a live pod

> **My prediction:** "If I `kubectl edit pod` to add `envFrom`, it's rejected (immutable), and I must `replace --force`; afterward `printenv` shows the ConfigMap + Secret values — *because* env is set at container start and can't change on a live pod."

```bash
kubectl create configmap web-config --from-literal=APP_COLOR=dark-blue
kubectl create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=DB_PASSWORD='p@ss123'
kubectl edit pod webapp-color        # add envFrom → save fails → kubectl saves to /tmp
kubectl replace --force -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-XXXXX.yaml
kubectl exec webapp-color -- printenv | grep -E 'APP_COLOR|DB_PASSWORD'
```
**Verify:** both values print after recreate. On a Deployment you'd just `kubectl edit deployment` (it rolls new pods automatically).

## Prediction 3 — An init container gates the app until its dependency exists

> **My prediction:** "If a pod has an init container that waits for service `mydb`, then the pod sits at `Init:0/1` until I create `mydb`, then flips to `Running` — *because* init containers must exit 0 before the main container starts."

```yaml
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: wait-db
    image: busybox:1.31
    command: ["sh","-c","until nslookup mydb; do echo waiting; sleep 2; done"]
  containers: [{ name: app, image: nginx }]
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f app.yaml
kubectl get pod app            # Init:0/1
kubectl logs app -c wait-db    # "waiting..."
kubectl expose deployment mydb --port=80    # nslookup succeeds → app starts
```
**Verify:** `Init:0/1` → `Running` only after `mydb` exists. The *init* container's logs (via `-c`) explain the block.

| Prediction: "If I do X, then Y, because [mechanism]" | Ran? | Right? | Miss? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. |  |  |  |

# 🎁 CAPSTONE — Compress It

**One sentence, no notes:**
> An app's process, config, secrets, replica count and update path all live in the Deployment's pod template — edit it and Kubernetes rolls a new ReplicaSet up as the old scales down (zero-downtime, reversible), while ConfigMaps/Secrets externalize settings and init/sidecar containers add setup and companions.

**Explain it to a beginner in 3 sentences:**
> 1. You never rebuild an image to change a setting or a password — you put those in ConfigMaps and Secrets and inject them into the pod.
> 2. To ship a new version you change the Deployment's template, and Kubernetes swaps pods a few at a time so users never see downtime — and keeps old versions so you can roll back instantly.
> 3. Extra containers can prepare the pod before the app starts (init) or run alongside it (sidecar), all sharing the pod's network and storage.

**Which rung to revisit hands-on?** Rung 3C — the ConfigMap/Secret injection shapes (`envFrom` vs `valueFrom` vs volume) and the "base64 ≠ encrypted" fact are the most-tested and most-confused.

---

## 🎯 CKA exam tips & quick notes

- **Rollout trio:** `kubectl set image deploy/x c=img:tag`, `kubectl rollout status|undo deploy/x`. Know cold.
- **`command` = ENTRYPOINT, `args` = CMD.** Container args after `--`; `--command` overrides the entrypoint.
- **Injection:** `envFrom` (whole), `env.valueFrom.*KeyRef` (one key), volume (files). `configMapRef`↔`secretRef`.
- **Secrets = base64, not encryption.** `echo -n x | base64` / `base64 -d`; `stringData:` skips manual encoding.
- **Immutable pod edit** → `kubectl replace --force -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-...yaml`; Deployment pods → `kubectl edit deployment`.
- **Init/sidecar debug:** `kubectl logs <pod> -c <container>`; `Init:x/y` = init phase.
- `kubectl create cm/secret --dry-run=client -o yaml > f.yaml` to template fast.

## 📌 Command cheat sheet

## ✅ Answers — "Check yourself before Rung N"

### Before Rung 2
**Q:** Name two things that force an image rebuild in the "before" world that Kubernetes lets you change *without* touching the image.

**A:** (1) **A setting (config value):** before, config was baked into the image, so a one-line change meant a rebuild-and-redeploy loop; Kubernetes externalizes it into a **ConfigMap** injected as env vars or files. (2) **A password (sensitive value):** before, secrets were baked into images or committed to Git — leaked forever; Kubernetes puts them in a **Secret** object injected at container start. In both cases you change the object and roll the pods — the image is never touched.

### Before Rung 3
**Q:** If you `kubectl set image` a Deployment to a broken image, why do your *existing* users usually keep getting served during the failed rollout?

**A:** Because a rollout is "a **new ReplicaSet** scaled up as the old one scales down" — the broken pods live entirely in the *new* ReplicaSet. Those pods go `ImagePullBackOff`/`CrashLoopBackOff` and never become Ready, so the Deployment never proceeds to scale the *old* ReplicaSet down; the old RS's healthy pods keep serving traffic the whole time. The failure is contained to the new RS, the rollout stalls, and `kubectl rollout undo` reverses it — that containment is exactly why rolling updates are "safe."

### Before Rung 4
**Q:** (1) Which pod field overrides the image's ENTRYPOINT? (2) Which injection method makes a ConfigMap show up as *files*? (3) Does base64-encoding a Secret make it secure — why/why not?

**A:** (1) **`command:`** overrides ENTRYPOINT (and `args:` overrides CMD — the classic trap is thinking `command` maps to Docker's CMD; it doesn't). (2) Mounting the ConfigMap as a **volume** (`volumes: - configMap: {name: ...}`) — each key becomes a file in the mount path; `envFrom` and `env.valueFrom` produce env vars, not files. (3) **No** — base64 is *encoding*, not encryption; anyone with etcd or API access can trivially `base64 -d` it back. Real safety comes from practice: don't commit secret YAML, enable **encryption at rest** on the API server, and restrict access with RBAC. Kubernetes helps a bit by sending a Secret only to nodes that need it and keeping it in tmpfs (RAM) on the kubelet.

### Before Rung 5
**Q:** Which of these trigger a new rollout when changed on a Deployment: `image`, `env`, `replicas`? Two do something different from the third — which, and why?

**A:** **`image` and `env` trigger a rollout; `replicas` does not.** `image` and `env` are fields *inside the pod template*, and the rule is: change the template → the Deployment creates a new ReplicaSet and performs a rollout, recorded as a new revision. `replicas` lives on the Deployment spec *outside* the pod template — changing it is pure scaling: the *existing* ReplicaSet is resized up or down, no new RS, no new revision, nothing to roll back.

### Before Rung 6
**Q:** In step 5 of the rollout trace, what specific pod condition stops the rollout from proceeding — and why is that the safety mechanism, not a bug?

**A:** The new pods never become **Ready** — with `nginx:doesnotexist` they sit in `ImagePullBackOff`, so the readiness condition that gates each batch is never met. The RollingUpdate engine only scales the old RS down (−1 per `maxUnavailable`) *after* the surged new pods pass readiness; since they never do, the rollout **stalls with the old ReplicaSet still at full strength and still serving**. That's the safety mechanism by design: readiness is the proof-of-health checkpoint between batches, so a bad version can never replace a good one — capacity stays ~100%, the blast radius is one stalled RS, and `rollout undo` cleanly reverses it.

### Before Rung 7
**Q:** A colleague changed a ConfigMap value but the running pods still show the old value. Why, and what makes it take effect?

**A:** Because the pods consume the ConfigMap as **env vars**, and env vars are set by the kubelet once, at container start, *before* the process runs — they are never updated on a live container. Changing the ConfigMap object afterward changes nothing inside already-running pods. To make it take effect you must **roll the pods** so new containers start and re-read the ConfigMap — e.g. `kubectl rollout restart deploy/web` or any pod-template change that triggers a rollout. (The exception: a ConfigMap mounted as a **volume** does eventually update live in the files — only env-injected config is frozen at start.)
